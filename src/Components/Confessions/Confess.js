                We collectively acknowledge the Grace of God and the gift of salvation.
                <br/>We thank God for eternal life, peace, daily benefits and spiritual blessings in heavenly places (Psalm 68:19, Eph 1:3)
                <br/>In SCM UI, we are built unto maturity; we keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.
                <br/>We walk in love
                <br/>We are totally yielded to the spirit of God
                <br/>Our affection is on Christ
                <br/>Our life is built on the Word
                <br/>The spirit of God is our teacher
                <br/>The power of God is manifest in love and all fruits of the Spirit
                <br/>The gifts and manifestation of the Spirit are ours
                <br/>
                <br/>We see the marvelous works of God in our midst (Eph 4:3, john 1:26, 1 Cor 12:7)
                <br/>We are in Christ Jesus
                <br/>We no longer walk after the flesh
                <br/>We now walk by the righteous nature of Christ
                <br/>For the law of the spirit of life in Christ has made us free from the law of sin and death (rom 8:2)
                <br/>The name of Jesus is our fortress and shield.
                <br/>Because we fear the Lord, His angels encamp around us. (Pro 18:10; Ps 34:7; 2Cor 10:5)
                <br/>
                <br/>We have the light of life; we walk by the Spirit; we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
                <br/>We are led by the Spirit of God, we do not walk in confusion, and we always know what to do
                <br/>We are the head and not the tail.
                <br/>We know more than our teachers for the word of God is our meditation. (Deut 28:13, Psalm 119:99, 1 Cor 2:10)
                <br/>The manifold wisdom of God is expressed in our academics. We are lifted in our academics; therefore, men are drawn to Christ.
                <br/>
                <br/>We know and believe in supernatural health and healing
                <br/>Christ bore our sickness and took away our infirmities.
                <br/>By His stripes we are healed
                <br/>Every cell and organ in our body is filled with the life of God.
                <br/>God satisfies us, our families and senior friends with long life and prosperity (Isaiah 53:5)
                <br/>The unsearchable riches of God belong to us
                <br/>We have finances in abundance.
                <br/>Our possessions are boundless.
                <br/>Our reach and coverage are limitless.
                <br/>Christ was made poor, so we are rich.
                <br/>
                <br/>We have wisdom and power to acquire tremendous wealth.
                <br/>(2 Cor 8:9)
                <br/>The peace of God permeates our lives.
                <br/>We turn the world around positively with creativity and witty inventions from God.
                <br/>We improve our world with god inspired ideas and innovations
                <br/>We take dominion over the entire world to the glory of Christ.
                <br/>(Phil 4:7-8, Eph 1:21)
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/><strong>WE ARE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD, WE CANNOT BE HIDDEN
                <br/>WE ARE THE SALT OF THE EARTH.
                <br/>WE ARE WORLD CHANGERS
                <br/>AS CHRIST IS, SO ARE WE IN THIS WORLD.</strong>
                <br/>(JOHN 5:13-14, 1 JOHN 4:17)
